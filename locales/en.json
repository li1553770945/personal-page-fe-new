        "description": "Responsible for MCP protocol adaptation work for Alibaba's gateway Higress, using Go to write Envoy plugins and load them as dynamic libraries, exposing Alibaba's existing HSF services in MCP protocol form from the gateway level, enabling Agents to directly call Alibaba's existing microservices. Optimized the original plugin compilation process, reducing single test time from 10 minutes to less than 1 minute, wrote multi-language gateway end-to-end tests, completed CI process design for plugins, implemented MCPServer metrics monitoring using OTEL and Grafana, and collaborated on developing MCPServer management page frontend and backend"
